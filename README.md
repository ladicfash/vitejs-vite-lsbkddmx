  - Web app must include home feed displaying previously created posts
  - By default, each post on the posts feed should show only the post's:

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x] Web app implements pseudo-authentication
  - Users can only edit and delete posts or delete comments by entering the secret key, which is set by the user during post creation

## Notes

### Challenges:
1. Implementing video uploads required debugging Supabase storage API and ensuring proper public URL generation.
2. Managing pseudo-authentication for users was challenging when associating posts and comments with IDs securely.
3. Designing a responsive and visually appealing interface consumed unexpected time but was rewarding in the end.

### Improvements:
- Ensured smooth user experience with animations and error handling.
- Added video embedding and deletion functionality for richer interactions.
